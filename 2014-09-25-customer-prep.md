# Meeting with Customers

Many years ago, a former owner of a company I worked for had a bit of 
advice that he had given to my boss. About 15 years ago, that was in
turn passed down to me, and it has always stuck with me across the
years.

> Always be prepared for the worst question they could possibly ask.

The theory is that if you're prepared for the worst, and you keep asking
over and over *"Is this really the worst?"* you'll be prepared for just
about anything, and you can probably wing the rest.

Out of all the training I've received and nuggets I've held on to, that
one comes to the front. At times, it's been the sole thought in my mind,
but that can get you in trouble.

Because, on its own, it fails to ask if you're preparing for the right
thing. Before we can know what the worst question they could ask is,
we need to know **what it is that they are interested in.** 

And *that* is where it's easy to fail or make a wrong assumption if we
haven't asked the correct questions up front.

How many times have you met with someone, whether they're a potential
customer, a former colleague, or some random person you bumped into at
a convention, and you subconsciously made a guess as to what they
wanted to discuss, and you start prepping the answer before the question
has even come out?

I tend to follow the pattern of brainstorm, focus, churn & focus like
crazy, then come back up for air and brainstorm again. But, that can
lead to very serial thinking, where I grab a topic, hold onto it, and
assume that everyone is interested in it and that's what everyone wants
to know.

This pattern of mine is both a strength and a weakness. I'm generally
aware of it and can keep it in check. This very moment helps prove that.
And I've been lucky, I guess. That serial focus tends to pay off down
the road, if I find myself in this situation. For example, a few years
ago, I obsessed over Aspect Oriented Programming. I didn't see it as the
golden hammer, but I wanted to learn a ton about it, and put it
everywhere that it made sense.

And that level of obsession generally pays off when I move onto the next
topic, because there are times I need to recall something like that.
Anyway, all that is to say that the one nugget I wish stuck with me more
than the quote above is a bit of training from Model-Netics, and that
is

Also it looks like I was taking a turn in thoughts, and maybe was going
to go with this stuff instead?

------------------------------

Also, I should do a better job about thinking about what are all the
topics I could be asked questions on first, because when I'm only
thinking about one ahead of time, that's probably not going to have the
worst question I could think of.


So, I sat down and started making a list. Then I remembered to ask myself "why?" I'll save the sales pitch on the training, but one of the best things I learned from Model-Netics was to always ask why. So, rather than stopping at the things I needed to do, I asked myself why I needed to do them.

It's so simple, and I've been burnt by it before, and yet, I forget to do it way too often.

So here I am, _"preparing for the worst question he could ask"_ and I realize, I may not even have the right question. I haven't bothered to ask what he needs yet!
