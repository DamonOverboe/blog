  "body": "# About Blog :-D\r\n\r\nPretty straightforward, really.\r\n\r\nIn the past, I've kept my raw Markdown blog files in Dropbox and then used a third party\r\nservice to sync and host them. First it was Posterous. Then it was Scriptogram.\r\n\r\nThe problem is, Twitter bought Posterous and nobody bought Scriptogram.\r\n\r\nSo for now, I'm putting them here as raw text. I know a lot of people use Git Pages to\r\nhost their files. And I know there are a lot of difficulties to deal with on that. But\r\none of the coolest uses I've seen is just putting these out there raw and letting Github\r\npresent them. The benefit of that is you have a system where people can comment or\r\nmake pull requests to improve the content.\r\n\r\nSo that's what I'm starting with, but I'm also continuing to host these at\r\n<http://damonoverboe.org>.\r\n\r\nThat's it or now.\r\n",
