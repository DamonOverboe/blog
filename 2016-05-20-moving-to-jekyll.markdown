Wulp... it's that time again. I have this pattern:

1. Find a cool free blog host that supports [Markdown][] *(I started this back in 2011 or so when
Wordpress had no clue what [Markdown][] was)*

2. Go all crazy on the publishing

3. Find out down the road the blog host has been bought or is shutting down

4. Stick my head in the sand for a while, hoping it's not true.

5. Find a new option, rinse & repeat.

I'm hoping to break that cycle. I'm going with running [Jekyll][] on my own droplet and
setting up post-commit hooks. 

So, in the mean time please forgive the clunkiness and non-formatted posts as I migrate.
And I hope to see you soon, and much more often than the last year or so.
