DevOps is not a methodology _(that was new to me)_ but instead a mind set or description of whatever it is your organization needs to do to take code from commit to production delivery.

## Why DevOps & Continuous Delivery? ##

XP and Agile are about shipping smaller pieces of software faster. This causes us to need automation to help with the process of commit through delivery.

On a 1-year project, spending one week at the end to build, install, test, and then deploy isn't that big of a hit.

Shipping monthly though, this becomes the bottleneck. Shipping weekly means you'll be spending a lot of money on Release Management or DevOps.
