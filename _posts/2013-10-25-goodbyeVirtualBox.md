**Subtitle: how to be completely rude and alienate your users**

For the past couple years, I have been using VirtualBox. I do *everything in it!* Time to time, I run into a problem, and I go to the flame wars hosted by Oracle.

When I first started using it, I had a couple friends I could go to and ask my n00b questions; they looked at me like I had just ran over their cat usually, and I'm sure they started making fun of my n00biness when I left, but that's the price you pay.

But now, due to lack of USB3 support, we have to part ways.

However, in my parting, I thought I'd take the opportunity to flame them too.

But if you look at the VirtualBox forums, they are full of nothing but hatred. To put it as nice as I possibly can, the developers or customer support seem to think that users are stupid and should not be bothering them.

While it appears that there may be a workaround, the developers seem pretty put off that you would expect a technology that is backward compatible to operate in their VMs.

So on that note, I say goodbye to VirtualBox.
