## Posterous x-6 & I need an auto-poster

Now that Posterous is dead *(and actually, I should have looked six months ago when their LinkedIn integration seemed to break)* I need an auto-poster for social media.

I'm not referring to scheduling the posts or anything like that. Instead, I have a couple basic workflows:

**Main Workflow:**

1. Post a blog here.
2. Update Google+
3. Update Twitter
4. Usually update LinkedIn

**Alternate Workflow:**

1. Post to Google+
2. Update Twitter
3. Occasionally update LinkedIn

## HootSuite Kind of Works

I've found [HootSuite](http://hootsuite.com), which claims to support Twitter, LinkedIn, and Google+. I was able to sign up through my Google account, and I was able to add Twitter and LinkedIn easily.

## But it DOES NOT support G+!!!

This is a big deal for me. As you can see in my workflows, I just don't care about Twitter. I fought it as long as possble, I'm on it, but I just don't care about it. It's had the history of being a vanity app where you tell people you're eating a cheeseburger. Yey you!

If you look up, you'll see I'm *slightly* over 140 characters, and maybe that explains something?!?

Back to my point, I was disappointed to see that my G+ in fact *WAS NOT* included. As I went through the efforts to add G+, I found that they do not really support G+, they support G+ pages!

There is a *HUGE* difference and this is extremely annoying.

+ All of my contacts are on G+; none are on G+ pages
+ "" pictures, profile settings, etc. ""
+ The Pages option is buried under `More` at the bottom left; you've probably never seen it, because even Google doesn't give it any credibility.
+ I'm sure I'm missing some other things...

## So I'm still looking...

I guess HootSuite will work for now; I have the G+ button which will allow me to just click on it to post, but that's still three steps. If anyone has any other recommendations, please let me know.

Click on [the title above](http://damonoverboe.org/post/testing-hootsuite-for-social-media-management) and you'll find the G+ and Twitter links.
