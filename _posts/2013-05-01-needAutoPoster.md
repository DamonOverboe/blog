While it only worked properly up until Twitter bought Posterous, I was able to post to Posterous and have it auto-post to LinkedIn and Twitter.

Scriptogra.am does not offer that, so I need a multi-posting tool for g+, LinkedIn, and Twitter (least important of the three).

I have Postus for Android which works fine if I'm sharing something from my phone; the only problem is I never share anything from my phone.

It would be awesome if I could have it subscribe to my site and have it auto-post to the trio.

My primary usage is going to be when I'm sitting down with a real keyboard.



Suggestions? Tell me on: 

+ g+: +damon.overboe
+ the bird: @damonoverboe
+ email *(if you already have it or can figure it out from this stuff)*
+ in person *(if you see me in person)*
+ carrier pigeon *(if you have one, because that would be cool)*
+ pidgin *(if you don't have a carrier pigeon and have my chat info.)*
