Maybe it's human nature, maybe it's just me, but it seems that as things are in flux I'm more likely to shake a few more things up. 

Almost a year ago, Twitter acquired Posterous and then subsequently managed to absolutely kill it. It's time to change this up. 

## Posterous is dead ##

Almost the reasons I chose Posterous seem to now be borked.

+ My auto-posts no longer work, including, get this, Twitter!

+ The theme that once looked great now has scroll bars everywhere.

+ It was easy and quick to set up. Now it feels clunky to get anything to work.

+ It accepted private / custom domains, allowing me to use http://damonoverboe.org.

+ The community presence has died off.

I hung with it for a while, but my activity has definitely suffered because of it. The only thing they still have going for it is one of the big deciding factors on why I chose Posterous, the ability to post via email in  [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown).

## Markdown? ##

Not a single day goes by where I don't write something in Markdown. I've [posted about it before](http://professional.damonoverboe.org/markdown), as have many others. It's plain text that is later rendered to HTML. You'll see a lot of `README.markdown` if you look around. I use it for writing emails, taking meeting minutes, templates, and most recently, my resume.

I may be a junky, but I'm not giving it up.

## What are my options? ##

I don't know them all, I'm sure. I'm looking for something that I can set up and forget, that simply waits for new content to mark up.

I found [this post](http://chieftech.com.au/markdown-and-blogging) where the author settled on [scriptogr.am](http://scriptogr.am/). He seemed to have somewhat the same goals I id, focus on the content, not the management of the site. It uses [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com) as the "CMS" and that seems pretty attractive to me. It creates a scriptogram folder in your Dropbox upon giving it permission. Since all of my posts were already archived in a 'posts' folder, this will be pretty easy to migrate.

Then there's [Obtvse and Svbtle](http://siliconangle.com/blog/2012/03/23/obtvse-vs-svbtle-new-markdown-based-minimal-blogging-engines-complete-with-controversy/) as apps you an host. [MObtvse](http://mobtvse.com/) looks dead simple to implement, but again, I don't want to have to manage an app if I can avoid it. 


## Direction for now - scriptogr.am ##

Most likely, it will be scriptogr.am. It was dead simple to set up, and I already had my posts saved in Dropbox. In fact, while writing this blog, in under two minutes I have set up an account and themed my blog: http://scriptogr.am/damonoverboe

A negative? My posts currently end in .markdown, and I think that's much more clear than the .md extension that striptogr.am wants. But that's pretty minor. And I'd call this a wash, but I'll have to convert all of my headers. Posterous used an almost non-intuitive set of headers with double braces, and they had to be set in the email subject. I hid these in comments, and scritogr.am expects variables in the document instead, similar to [S9](http://slideshow.rubyforge.org/) (Markdown -> HTML slideshow. PowerPoint is fundamentally flawed, as are all of it's clones). So I'll have to make a few changes but that should be pretty simple.

*Side note, I'll be able to hook in my custom domain, damonoverboe.org, as well. I'll complete that before I nix Posterous altogether, but you shouldn't see a difference other than a theme change hopefully.*
