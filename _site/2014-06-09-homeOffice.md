*The second major overhaul of my home office*

Two years ago, I moved my office from a guest bedroom into the master (and vice versa).

Even prior to that, my 10' x 12' home office is far superior to many of the sad excuses that employers like to provide.

But, it was cramped and resulted in me staring into a wall, just like the cube farms. So, I took over the somewhat dinky master bedroom at 13' x 15' and it made a great office.

I have space all around my desk, up-lighting and a great view of the outdoors if I open my windows.

When I first set up the office, I used a 3-tier wire shelf based off of a setup I saw on <lifehacker.com>.

I've now replaced that *(because it's great for desktops but sucks for laptops)* with a [wall-mount magazine rack](http://www.amazon.com/Spectrum-3-Tier-Wall-Mount-Holder-Magazine/dp/B001RLUMYK/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8&qid=1402379547&sr=8-9&keywords=wall+mount+wire+magazine) to hold the laptops, organize [my HDMI KVM](http://www.amazon.com/Syba-2-Port-Compact-Switch-SY-KVM31034/dp/B00ANSVQPW/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1402380705&sr=8-3&keywords=hdmi+kvm), etc; the blinds are shut and it's nighttime, so you don't see the great outdoors, but here's the desk setup:

*Side note: Samsung's S5 camera sucks compared to HTC's, based on a 3 y.o. phone. Please enjoy the pixels, but don't steal any because these pics look bad enough as it is.*

[This rack](http://www.amazon.com/Winsome-Wood-Magazine-Rack-Espresso/dp/B000NPQHJ0/ref=sr_1_19?ie=UTF8&qid=1402379327&sr=8-19&keywords=magazine+rack) would better match my setup, but I prefer the open wire style for airflow. A bit of hackery could make this work though.

I'm using the [single monitor swingarm stand](http://www.amazon.com/Adjustable-Tilting-Mount-Bracket-13~30inch/dp/B005C2914C/ref=pd_sim_sbs_e_1?ie=UTF8&refRID=15CY3EDTT8ZT54YEFJYS) because I'm old-school and have reverted back from multiple monitors and now much prefer a decent sized monitor with multiple desktops.

My desk protector is also somewhat roots; I have the Rhinolin I protector which is now out of stock, but offers a much less reflective surface than the Rhinolin II. I also have a smaller one in the keyboard drawer. They have an open-cell foam backing, which sucks compared to the newer version, but the look and feel of the surface make it worth it. If I were to go any other direction, it would be a leather protector. 

The keyboard is the [Kinesis Freesytle 2](http://www.amazon.com/Kinesis-KB800PB-US-Freestyle2-keyboard/dp/B0089ZSEMO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1402380087&sr=8-1&keywords=kinesis+freestyle+2) with the [VIP 3 accessory kit](http://www.amazon.com/Kinesis-Freestyle2-VIP3-Accessory-keyboard/dp/B008BVNQW4/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1402380087&sr=8-2&keywords=kinesis+freestyle+2). Don't even consider buying this keyboard without the [accessory kit](http://www.amazon.com/Kinesis-Freestyle2-VIP3-Accessory-keyboard/dp/B008BVNQW4/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1402380087&sr=8-2&keywords=kinesis+freestyle+2) because it will be almost useless; the only reason they don't include it is to try to hit some artificial price-point. *I don't use the gel pads but the palm rest and stands are a must.* The Kinesis allows me to position to any vertical pitch from 0 to 15 degrees, as much separation as you would probably want, and really any angle you can dream of. I go with a 10 degree vertical pitch and unlocked horizontal positioning and spread.

It replaces the [Kensington SlimType](http://www.amazon.com/Kensington-K72357US-Keyboard-Compatible-Black/dp/B00426HI8U/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1402379945&sr=8-1&keywords=kensington+slim+type+keyboard) keyboards that I used for several years. I switched because while these feature scissor switch technology making them mostly feel like a laptop keyboard, the keys are just too stiff for me and I needed the ergonomic split.

And finally, the Piney River glass from [Piney River Brewing Company](http://pineyriverbrewing.com). You should have one.

The desk itself is a $130 job from [Target's avington collection.](http://www.target.com/p/threshold-avington-desk-dark-tobacco/-/A-10708661) For a department store desk, it's actually pretty good and I love the look and functionality of it. The keyboard drawer is the right height. Plus, I'm a masher and the drawer doesn't flex while I'm clickity clacking.

All told, not counting the monitor or keyboard because the monitor is old and your keyboard preference will likely differ, I have under $300 in this setup *(although Tux is priceless)* and I'm extremely pleased with it.

Approximate prices as of 2014-06-09, excluding tax/shipping/travel(Piney River):

+ KVM:  $50
+ Desk: $130
+ Piney River Glass: $5
+ Monitor Stand: $35
+ Magazine Stand: $18
+ Rhinolin Desk: $35
+ Rhinolin Keyboard: $25
+ Hatemail to Anthem Blue Cross B.S.: included
+ Dell speakers: free with just about any computer, including non-dell computers
+ Dana: not available. I may part with the picture frame if the price is right, but the pic won't be included.
+ Tux: special order, this one won't be migrating but you might be able to find his brother?
+ In the background: [magnetic whiteboard by The Board Dudes](http://www.amazon.com/Board-Dudes-Decor-Magnetic-87060UN-4/dp/B001G60IT0/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1402381684&sr=8-4&keywords=the+board+dudes) at $30; because it's background I'm not mentioning it here, well at least not much. Mentioning it would push me over the $300 so that's why it's not mentioned here, and you're just imagining this paragraph. But you have a great imagination, especially since this aspect is really just in one of the photos and quite a bit fuzzy. Good job!
