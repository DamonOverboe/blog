# About Blog :-D

Pretty straightforward, really.

In the past, I've kept my raw Markdown blog files in Dropbox and then used a third party
service to sync and host them. First it was Posterous. Then it was Scriptogram.

The problem is, Twitter bought Posterous and nobody bought Scriptogram.

So for now, I'm putting them here as raw text. I know a lot of people use Git Pages to
host their files. And I know there are a lot of difficulties to deal with getting Google etc
to find them correctly. One of the coolest uses I've seen is just putting these out there raw and letting Github
present them. The benefit of that is you have a system where people can comment or
make pull requests to improve the content.

So, I'll end up taking the lazy approach to Github pages (see
<http://damonoverboe.github.io/blog/>) but I'm also continuing to host these at
<http://damonoverboe.org>.

That's it for now.
